"There are many ways to categorize programming languages; one is to define them as either" println
"'concatenative' or 'applicative'. In an applicative language, things are evaluated by applying" println
"functions to arguments. This includes almost all programming languages in wide use, such as" println
"C, Python, ML, Haskell, and Java. In a concatenative programming language, things are" println
"evaluated by composing several functions which all operate on a single piece of data, passed" println
"from function to function. This piece of data is usually in the form of a stack. Additionally, in" println
"concatenative languages, this function composition is indicated by concatenating programs." println
"Examples of concatenative languages include Forth, Joy, PostScript, Cat, and Factor." println
